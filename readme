SM2: asymmetric encryption algorithm based on ECC, including encryption and digital signature processes

SM3: hash algorithm

SM4: symmetric encryption algorithm

Random numbers are needed when applying SM2, and in most cases, we don't have a hardware random number generator. 
Thus I wrote 'rand.cpp' for random numbers gereration. 
The main idea is that the increment of CPU time stamp between your two accesses is unpredictable.
Hopefully, unlike other pseudo-random number generators, this one is quite random.
